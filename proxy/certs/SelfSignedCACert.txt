Generation of a Self Signed Certificate
Generation of a self-signed SSL certificate involves a simple 3-step procedure:

STEP 1: Create the server private key
openssl genrsa -out cert.key 2048

STEP 2: Create the certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key cert.key -out cert.csr

STEP 3: Sign the certificate using the private key and CSR
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in cert.csr -signkey cert.key -out cert.crt

Congratulations! You now have a self-signed SSL certificate valid for 10 years.

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 \
    -subj "/C=CN/ST=BJ/L=BJ/O=Global Security/OU=Test Department/CN=f.ll.tt" \
    -keyout cert.key  -out cert.crt
